<h3>"Solving Cooking Decision Paralysis"</h3> </br>

Hello! This is an app I'm currently in the development of where I aim to aid users in deciding what to cook based off of what is in their kitchens at the moment. </br>

There will be no need for last moment grocery runs or deciding on what to eat for 3 hours. The app will store all the tools--such as pots, pans, measuring cup, etc--and the ingredients in your pantry and fridge. Then the app will continously update a feed of web-scraped recipes to create based on what you already have! </br>

This is the current appearance of the app as of the last main PR: </br></br>
